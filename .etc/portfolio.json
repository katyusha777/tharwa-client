    "overall_analysis": "The portfolio is moderately diversified across sectors including precious metals (Gold), technology (NVIDIA), digital assets (USDT), fintech (Nu Holdings), energy\/crypto mining (TeraWulf), and regional banking (Doha Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank). However, there is a significant concentration risk with Philip Morris International (PM) representing approximately 76% of the portfolio value, which is also non-Shariah compliant. Sentiment is generally positive for most assets except TeraWulf and the regional banks which show neutral to cautious sentiment. The portfolio aligns moderately with prudent management but needs rebalancing to reduce concentration and compliance risks.",

    "compliance_summary": "The portfolio is predominantly Shariah-compliant with all assets except Philip Morris International, which constitutes a large portion of the portfolio and poses a compliance risk. The presence of a single non-compliant asset significantly weakens the overall compliance profile. Strength lies in the inclusion of Shariah-compliant financial institutions and technology companies, but the large non-compliant holding requires attention.",
